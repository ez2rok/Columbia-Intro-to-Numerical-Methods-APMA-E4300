# Columbia Intro to Numerical Methods (APMA E4300)

### Lecture notes
The lecture notes were developed by Columbia Professor Kyle Mandli and consist of Jupyter notebooks branched from his repo [here](https://github.com/mandli/intro-numerical-methods).

### Homeworks 
Homeworks completed by Ethan Turok (me) in Fall 2021 when the course was taughy by Columbia Professor Marc Spiegelman.

### Material
This class covers:
1. Error Analysis
2. Root Finding
3. Interpolation
4. Numerical Differentiation
5. Numerical Integration (Quadrature)
6. Numerical Solutions to ODEs
7. Numerical Methods for Linear Algebra (SVD, QR Factorization)


My experience with this course can be summed up by this:
